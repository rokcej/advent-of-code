# Advent of Code 2018

I decided to use C for this one. Having to write data structures from scratch was quite a pain, so I doubt I'll be using it for Advent of Code again.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed the puzzles a lot. They gave me something to look forward to every day, and a new way of celebrating Christmas.

* Compile solutions with:
	```bash
	gcc part1.c -o part1
	gcc part2.c -o part2
	```
* Run solutions with:
	```bash
	./part1 < input
	./part2 < input
	```
